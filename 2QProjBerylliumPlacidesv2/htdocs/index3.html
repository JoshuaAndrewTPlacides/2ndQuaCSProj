                    Even after surviving colonialism by the Spaniards, the Philippines still couldn’t escape the clutches of homophobia. American colonialism, like the Spaniards, introduced the notion that homosexuals have some sort of mental illness. In response to this, Filipino homosexuals at the time tries treating themselves in conversion camps – institutions that forced homosexuals into heterosexuality.

                    Even in the Japanese occupation, LGBTQ members became mere sexual objects to the eyes of the Japanese. To this day, thousands of Filipina comfort women and men are left with no compensation from the Japanese government.

                <p>Towards the 60s and 70s, the Philippines went under martial law in the time of the Marcoses – a time where strife and suffering were given to those who dared oppose the government. LGBTQ+ Filipinos were not only silenced but also tortured and harassed by the military. This had gone to a point where many LGBTQ+ Filipinos fled to other nations to seek refuge. Eventually, when the Marcoses held a power no more in Malacanang, those Filipinos returned to the Philippines, bringing with them new gay and lesbian concepts and cultures.</p>

                <p>The end of the 1980s saw a rise in LGBT awareness as entertainment such as that of Helen Cruz (a transgender activist and singer) and numerous gay plays that tackled the concept of “coming out” spread like wildfire in Philippine society. The 1990s saw no decline in LGBT awareness as the decade saw the rise of Philippine LGBT organizations such as that of UP Babaylan and ProGay Philippines. </p>
                    
                <p>The 2000s and 2010s were all the more kinder to LGBT Filipinos as more LGBT organizations banded together to aid in the needs of LGBT members in the Philippines. With the advent of the internet and later, social media, LGBT concepts were introduced into the homes of Filipinos nationwide. According to the ASEAN SOGIE Caucus in 2017, the Philippines is in its course to be more “open and accepting of LGBT issues”.</p>
