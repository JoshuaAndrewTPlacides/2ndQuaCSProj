            <h1>Effects of Philippine Homophobia on LGBTQIA+ Filipinos</h1>

                <p>Even in the era of today, prejudice against LGBTQ+ Filipinos is embedded in the very cracks of Philippine society. Largely due to the patriarchy and heteronormativity brought by Spanish and American colonizers, shunning effeminate men (and masculine women) is still the norm especially in impoverished areas and provinces. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Moreover, LGBTQ+ Filipinos have less rights in their own country. For example, as of 2022, the Philippines does not legally recognize same-sex marriages, and 61% of Filipinos think this should be the case.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="section2">
                <img src="../images/img_4_2.jpg" width="35%" id="image2">
                <p>Because of this homophobia, evidently, LGBTQ+ Filipinos are severely affected through many ways. For one, this can impact them psychologically. According to multiple studies, suicide ideation is something more prevalent in homosexuals than in heterosexuals. In response to this, multiple organizations were formed to support those in need in the LGBTQ+ community through services such as incentives and suicide hotlines.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For another, many homosexuals are forced into gender conversion therapy. The Philippines has no laws nor policies to inhibit gender conversion therapy – in fact, most countries have no such laws. As such, religious facilities and churches have promoted religious practices such as praying to help “suppress homosexual thoughts and desires”. Worst of all, some homosexuals are open to these kinds of therapy, thinking that what they feel isn’t normal. Such was apparently the case for President Duterte’s who said that he was “once gay, but he cured himself of it”.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, LGBTQ+ Filipinos (and that of the rest of the world’s) are likely to experience violence and abuse likely rooted in internalized homophobia.</p>

                <p>Such was the case of Jennifer Laude’s, a trans woman who was drowned in a toilet bowl by US Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton after he found out that she was transgender. Despite being charged of homicide, Pemberton to this day remains released, having granted absolute pardon by President Rodrigo Duterte himself on September 7, 2020. </p>
                <br>
                <p>This hasn’t been taken lightly by LGBTQ+ communities though – many organizations such as Bahaghari have held rallies and protests against Pemberton’s pardon.</p>
