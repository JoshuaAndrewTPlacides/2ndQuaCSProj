                <p>Evidently, prejudice against the LGBTQ+ community of the Philippines is still prevalent. And it has many roots – from the patriarchy woven into the fabric of Filipino culture to the false notion that homosexuality is a mental illness. These ideas introduced to us by our colonizers torment those in the LGBTQ+ community and inhibit any chance of full acceptance within our society. Truly, Philippines has a severe case of <em>omofovia</em>.</p>
                <p> <br>
                This severe case, however, isn’t uncurable – homophobia within societies can still be fixed by the implementation of adequate sex education and a general acceptance and openminded-ness to LGBT culture within Filipino society. That way, homosexuals of the now may not experience the discrimination and distraught brought on by homophobes and conservatives of the then.
